# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> One concept that I learned was to keep track of the different variables and functions in the code that gets used often. Otherwise it may be difficult doing proper js style code. The example code was a good start to trying to understand what each function does. The issue was that I was having troubles translating the code within the index.js file. One change that could have been easier would be having pre-exiting comments but that was the reason of this assignment. 

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
>What raising the level of abstraction means is that you should get an idea of what the code does and be able to use it without actually reading the code. Don't have comments say why the code is being used, comment on what the code is being used to do without over-describing it. You don't need to particularly label every single data structure used but it may be useful to specify data structures of any parameters or return variables. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
>This assignment took around 10 hours spaced over 4 days.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
>I received help from some classmates to get a general understanding of the library used. I also asked questions on some confusing functions or complex coding structure that I did not fully understand. The classmates were Chennan Mao and Henry Zhang. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
>I did not have a problem with this but I know other students had problems with some of the proposed libraries having file types or structures that they were unfamiliar with (.ini and MIDI). Having a larger list of potential libraries or a written background in how to get started on the more complicated ones would be useful for future classes.
